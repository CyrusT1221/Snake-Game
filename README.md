**Snake Game**

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java. The game provides a nostalgic experience for players, allowing them to control a snake as it moves around the game board, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
